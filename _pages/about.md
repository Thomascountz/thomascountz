I work at Zendesk as a Senior Engineer and Tech Lead on the Ruby infrastructure team, overseeing the systems that power Ruby and Rails across our products and services.

On this site, I write about anything that piques my interest—building web applications, tinkering with electronics, experimenting with 3-D printing, or exploring open-source data science.

My career is guided by three principles: to create, to learn, and to share.
