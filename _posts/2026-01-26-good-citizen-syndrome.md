**Good Citizen Syndrome is what happens when engineering leaders—often unwittingly—confuse good reliable engineers with good reliability engineering.**

Skilled engineers who care about reliability constantly step in to fill gaps in process and standards. They're _Good Citizens_. While this _can_ be a sign of a mature organization, latent conditions persist when leadership mistakes this vigilance for sustainable systemic health.

In his book about organizational culture, Karl Weick calls reliability a "dynamic non-event;" a phrase which underscores the false sense of safety good reliability can cause.

> Reliability is dynamic in the sense that it is an ongoing condition in which problems are momentarily under control due to compensating changes in components... Operators see nothing and seeing nothing, presume that nothing is happening.[^weick]

[^weick]: Weick, K. E. (1987). Organizational culture as a source of high reliability. _California Management Review_, 29(2), 112-127.

When reliability engineering[^2] is done well, nothing bad happens. When nothing bad happens, it looks like nothing is being done at all. **But it takes a lot of work to make nothing happen!**

[^2]: Replace "reliability engineering" with any practice you care about, e.g. security, quality assurance, compliance, maintenance, etc.
